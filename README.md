# Happy Hour Scour

## Description & Background

Nashville is known for its hospitality and local food scene, and I love playing host to friends and family who visit by showcasing the restaurants and bars Nashville has to offer. For my full-stack project, I wanted to build an application that helps support local businesses and their exposure, while also helping users on a budget. A user can search and filter happy hours by today's day or any day of the week, location, drink types, food, and more to find the best spot based on what they offer and what a user is looking for.
